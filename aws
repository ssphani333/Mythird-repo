Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and widely adopted 
cloud computing platform, providing on-demand IT resources and services over the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. 
Instead of companies needing to buy, own, and maintain physical data centers and servers, 
they can access a vast array of services—including computing power, data storage, and 
databases—managed by Amazon's secure, global network of data centers. 
This approach allows businesses of all sizes, from startups to large enterprises and government agencies, to l
ower their IT costs, scale their operations instantly as needed, and innovate faster.
